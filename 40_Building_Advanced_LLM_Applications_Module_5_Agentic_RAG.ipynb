Essentially we use agents instead of a LLM directly to accomplish a set of tasks which requires planning, multi step reasoning, tool use and/or learning over time. Agents give us agency!!!\n",

        "Usage patterns for Agents in a RAG context comprises of the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "-- Use an existing RAG pipeline as a tool by an agent\n",
        "\n",
        "-- Use an agent itself as a RAG tool\n",
        "\n",
        "-- Use an agent to retrieve tools from a RAG (Vector index) at query time using a provided context.\n",
        "\n",
        "-- Use an agent to do query planning over a set of existing tools\n",
        "\n",
        "-- Use an agent to select a tool from candidate tools which have been retrieved from a pool of tools using RAG.(This is especially useful when we have a large set of tools to select from)\n",
        "\n",
        "One can also mix and match the above usage patterns to realise a complex RAG application.\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG Agents can be further classified based on function. They can be used for routing, one-shot query planning, tool use, reason + act (ReAct) and dynamic planning and execution. These range from simple, low cost and low latency to complex, high cost and high latency.\n",

        "## Routers\n",
        "Routing agent essentially uses an LLM to pick what downstream RAG pipeline to pick. This is agentic reasoning as it uses an LLM to reason about what RAG pipeline to pick based on the input query. This is the simplest form of agentic reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Another class of routing is to select between Summarization and Question Answering RAG pipelines. Based on the input query the agent reasons about routing to the Summary query engine or the Vector Query Engine that are configured as tools."

            "The essay by Paul Graham provides a comprehensive and personal account of his journey through various phases of his career, highlighting his experiences, insights, and the evolution of his work and interests. It begins with his early interests in writing and programming, leading to his exploration of Lisp and the creation of Viaweb, which was later acquired by Yahoo. Graham discusses the founding of Y Combinator (YC), a pioneering startup accelerator, and its impact on the startup ecosystem, including the introduction of the batch model and the focus on founder-friendly practices. He also touches on the development of Hacker News as a community platform and his return to programming with the creation of a new Lisp dialect called Bel. Throughout the essay, Graham reflects on the themes of discovery, the importance of working on what genuinely interests you, and the value of pursuing less prestigious or conventional paths to find real innovation and fulfillment. The narrative is interspersed with personal anecdotes, including his move to England and his decision to focus on painting, providing a nuanced view of his philosophy on work, creativity, and life.\n"

            "Paul Graham co-founded Y Combinator (YC), initially funding it with his own money. He was instrumental in conceptualizing and implementing the unique batch model of funding startups, where a group of startups would be funded all at once, twice a year, and then intensely mentored over three months. This model was a departure from traditional venture capital practices and was designed to provide startups with the early-stage support and resources they needed, much like the support Graham himself had received from Julian. Graham also played a key role in the operational aspects of YC, using his own building in Cambridge as the headquarters and organizing weekly dinners where experts on startups were brought in to give talks. Additionally, he was responsible for the creation of the Summer Founders Program, aimed at encouraging undergraduates to start their own companies over the summer, which led to YC receiving a significant number of applications and ultimately broadening its scope beyond just undergraduates. Graham's vision and actions were central to establishing Y Combinator's innovative approach to startup funding and mentoring.\n"
