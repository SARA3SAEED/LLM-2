You can run an A/B test to measure the performance of many different parts of your sales funnel, including your email campaigns, landing pages, ad campaigns and more. And a few hours of work could lead to big boosts in conversions, revenue, and more.\\nYou can use split-testing to optimize your sales funnel.\\nSo what is split testing anyways? Basically, you will test two or more different versions of your campaign or asset. Let\\u2019s say you want to A/B test your landing page. You might set up one landing page with a call-to-action (CTA) that says \\u201cClick here to learn how to increase your ecommerce sales!\\u201d and another CTA that states \\u201cClick Here to Enjoy a Free Trial!\\u201d then measure which one performs better.\\nIdeally, when you A/B test something, you change only one thing between the two versions. So when split testing the call to action, you won\\u2019t change around images, buttons, or anything else. Your goal is to determine exactly what is causing performance to increase (or decrease).\\nExample of a simple A/B test. Notice the different click buttons.\\nIf you change multiple elements at once, it\\u2019ll be hard (if not impossible) to determine which one is causing the change. By testing only one thing at a time, you can hone in on changes that are making a difference.\\nHowever, in order to determine whether something is having an impact or not, you need to gather a lot of data. We\\u2019re not talking about dozens of clicks, but instead thousands or even tens of thousands. If you test every individual word change and element individually, it can be difficult to collect enough data.\\nLet\\u2019s say you want to try a new CTA and you want to know the impact of this CTA and button throughout your entire sales funnel. You can do this with a multi-page A/B test. You will simply apply the new CTA at every relevant stage of your funnel.\\nThe orange \\u201cGet Started for Free\\u201d button is an example of a CTA from PayKickstart\\u2019s site.\\nMost sales funnels feature multiple pages, and most pages will offer you an opportunity to use your CTA. You can set up two funnels, one with the old CTA, another with the new CTA, and then test the performance of each sales funnel on the whole.\\nCustomers are going to progress through each phase of your funnel. You can split test different steps of this funnel to see how each step is performing. For example, you could test one version of a landing page. Then when the customer clicks on the first link and goes to the product info page, you can A/B test that product info page as well.\\nNext, the customer might check out with the product. Here again, you can A/B test the shopping cart to see what features, tools, or language is working best. In this case, a single customer interaction allows you to test multiple things at once. However, since you are A/B testing individual pages against one another, you can still hone in on what is producing results and what\\u2019s not.\\nIf you\\u2019re thinking about a huge shake-up, say changing your entire marketing language or the overall feel of your brand, testing simply a logo change or a call-to-action might not be enough. Instead, you can A/B test your entire approach to see if the radical shake-up will produce results.\\nSo if you design a whole new website with a more modern look and more aggressive copy, you could A/B test that against your old website. If results are negative, your branding shift might not work. In this case, you may want to try to hone in on what\\u2019s causing the drop in performance.\\nCheck out the redesigns to Yahoo!\\u2019s homepage. It\\u2019d be hard to test each individual element.\\nSo maybe you go back and adjust your calls-to-action to make them less aggressive. At the same time, you could test your new, modern looking website with less aggressive language. If the results are positive and you start producing more conversions, now you have good reason to believe that the updated website is a boon but the aggressive language is not.\\nWant to test a number of variables at once? It is possible, especially if you have a lot of traffic. Keep in mind that the testing itself might not be quite as accurate as A/B testing a single variable. However, let\\u2019s be honest, if you want to test a large number of individual variables, you may not have enough time to A/B test every single one.\\nIMDb changed a lot of elements in the two above websites. It would take a long time to test each variable separately.\\nWith multivariate testing, you can swap a number of variables. The trick is to test every possible combination to see which ones work best and which ones are performing worse. If you have a common element turns up in your lowest performing ones, say a certain purchase button or CTA, you can take an educated guess and surmise that the specific element is lowering performance.\\nLikewise, if certain elements turn up consistently in your best-performing variations, there\\u2019s a good chance that these elements are improving performance. You can hone down your tests, dropping the worst performing combinations and elements until you end up with your best performing combination of variables.\\nSplit Testing takes commitment. You\\u2019re going to need to test a considerable amount of traffic to gather enough data to uncover meaningful insights. And a proper split testing campaign can take weeks, if not months to complete.\\nThis is especially true if you want to test a variety of elements. Still, the payoff will ultimately worth it. Using data, you should be able to increase your sales and conversions.\",\n          \"Asia's major oil consuming nations have decided to release crude oil from their respective strategic petroleum reserves in coordinated efforts with the US to ease the price burden on Asia Pacific consumers, but some of the top Asian economies believe there are more effective ways to tame consumer inflation such as lowering fuel taxes.\\nNot registered?\\nReceive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience.Register Now\\nIndia, China, South Korea and Japan said they plan to release their state oil reserves after the White House announced Nov. 23 that the US will release 50 million barrels from its SPR early next year.\\nIndia has agreed to release 5 million barrels of crude oil from its SPR, while China is poised to release more crude from state reserves amid expectations that the second set of auctions could potentially include at least 7 million barrels of medium sweet ESPO blend crude.\\nSouth Korea will release crude from its SPR, with a source at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy indicating that Seoul could offer about 3.8 million barrels.\\nJapan will also sell part of the country's national petroleum reserves. Tokyo's sales of national petroleum reserves will be made by advancing its planned sales of crude oil grades for replacement in the national petroleum reserves without violating the country's petroleum stockpiling law. The sales could amount to around \\\"a couple of hundred thousand kiloliters,\\\" according to Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Koichi Hagiuda.\\nHowever, the volume of the major Asian economies' SPR releases disappointed global market participants, while New Delhi, Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo and have all failed to provide any timeline for their crude releases so far.\\n\\\"Asia's SPR release was below expectations and it is [even understood to be] an exchange deal... buyers need to return the oil in 2022 to 2024,\\\" a crude trader based in Singapore said.\\nThe combined total of the four nations' crude releases account for only a tiny portion of their SPRs. Many Asian nations are not exactly keen on fully utilizing national reserves, with state-run oil companies and major private refiners in Northeast and Southeast Asia indicating that the true purpose of the SPR is for critical events such as drastic supply disruptions due to major geopolitical events like war, not for commercial reasons like high prices.\\nIn addition, quality concerns could limit demand from Japanese refiners as a large quantity of crude oil in Japan's SPR has been sealed in the same tanks for more than decades, according to refinery and trading sources with close knowledge of the matter.\\nTax cuts, subsidies\\nAuthorities in South Korea and Japan are seeking to implement more constructive ways to tackle the rising consumer inflation and help ease the burden on consumers struggling with high retail fuel prices.\\nEarlier this month, South Korea's Ministry of Economy and Finance decided to lower taxes on auto fuels by as much as 20% for six months from November, as part of efforts to ease rise in pump prices.\\nIn Japan, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry decided to provide subsidies to curb increases in retail prices of gasoline, kerosene, gasoil and fuel oil from the end of December to end of March in an effort to aid domestic transportation fuel consumers.\\nTax cuts and subsidies can effectively and promptly bring prices down for consumers, but it takes months for the big international benchmark price moves to be fully reflected in daily life for the average citizen and retail gas stations, according to middle distillate marketers at Japan's Cosmo Oil and South Korea's S-Oil Corp.\\nOPEC+ hike, not cut\\nOil industry and refinery sources across Asia indicated that although OPEC and its allies are adopting a cautious approach in the group's production strategy, the producers are still raising production, albeit at a slower-than-desired rate.\\nOPEC and its allies are standing firm on increasing crude output quotas by a modest 400,000 b/d each month. In contrast, nine major Asian refiners surveyed by S&P Global Platts -- including PTT, BPCL, ENEOS, SK Innovation, Petronas and PetroChina -- indicated the producer group should ideally raise supply by at least 800,000 b/d as current oil prices appear too high and consumer sentiment is hurt by prices at these levels.\\nHowever, the current market fundamentals are far from what Asian oil and refining industry would classify as a 'state emergency' as the OPEC+ is still looking to raise output and the group is not actually reducing supply, according to trading managers and plant operation managers at the major Asian refiners surveyed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9591,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"What happens to the proportion of the mirror occupied by Venus's face as you get closer to it?\",\n          \"What is the size and price of the smaller signs the author decided to make?\",\n          \"What was the subject of the program given by Suffolk University Law School\\u2019s Intellectual Property section on Monday, February 04, 2019?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9598,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Move My Car has been moving cars from Devonport to Devonport for over 25 years.\",\n          \"The purpose of split testing in marketing campaigns is to increase the performance of various marketing campaigns and the entire sales funnel.

The sales could amount to around \\\"a couple of hundred thousand kiloliters,\\\" according to Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Koichi Hagiuda.\\nHowever, the volume of the major Asian economies' SPR releases disappointed global market participants, while New Delhi, Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo and have all failed to provide any timeline for their crude releases so far.\\n\\\"Asia's SPR release was below expectations and it is [even understood to be] an exchange deal... buyers need to return the oil in 2022 to 2024,\\\" a crude trader based in Singapore said.\\nThe combined total of the four nations' crude releases account for only a tiny portion of their SPRs. Many Asian nations are not exactly keen on fully utilizing national reserves, with state-run oil companies and major private refiners in Northeast and Southeast Asia indicating that the true purpose of the SPR is for critical events such as drastic supply disruptions due to major geopolitical events like war, not for commercial reasons like high prices.\\nIn addition, quality concerns could limit demand from Japanese refiners as a large quantity of crude oil in Japan's SPR has been sealed in the same tanks for more than decades, according to refinery and trading sources with close knowledge of the matter.\\nTax cuts, subsidies\\nAuthorities in South Korea and Japan are seeking to implement more constructive ways to tackle the rising consumer inflation and help ease the burden on consumers struggling with high retail fuel prices.\\nEarlier this month, South Korea's Ministry of Economy and Finance decided to lower taxes on auto fuels by as much as 20% for six months from November, as part of efforts to ease rise in pump prices.\\nIn Japan, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry decided to provide subsidies to curb increases in retail prices of gasoline, kerosene, gasoil and fuel oil from the end of December to end of March in an effort to aid domestic transportation fuel consumers.\\nTax cuts and subsidies can effectively and promptly bring prices down for consumers, but it takes months for the big international benchmark price moves to be fully reflected in daily life for the average citizen and retail gas stations, according to middle distillate marketers at Japan's Cosmo Oil and South Korea's S-Oil Corp.\\nOPEC+ hike, not cut\\nOil industry and refinery sources across Asia indicated that although OPEC and its allies are adopting a cautious approach in the group's production strategy, the producers are still raising production, albeit at a slower-than-desired rate.\\nOPEC and its allies are standing firm on increasing crude output quotas by a modest 400,000 b/d each month. In contrast, nine major Asian refiners surveyed by S&P Global Platts -- including PTT, BPCL, ENEOS, SK Innovation, Petronas and PetroChina -- indicated the producer group should ideally raise supply by at least 800,000 b/d as current oil prices appear too high and consumer sentiment is hurt by prices at these levels.\\nHowever, the current market fundamentals are far from what Asian oil and refining industry would classify as a 'state emergency' as the OPEC+ is still looking to raise output and the group is not actually reducing supply, according to trading managers and plant operation managers at the major Asian refiners surveyed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

That\\u2019s especially true now that the 40-years-and-older women who date younger men have their own beauty pageant.\\nLos Angeles resident CC Perkinson was crowned Miss Cougar 2010 Del Mar last week in the second annual contest. The LA Weekly reports she received over 1,600 votes via Twitter and texting, beating out 24 other women for the, um, prestigious title.\\nMy first reaction, as a feminist, is to roll my eyes. The concept of women lining up to be be judged in a \\u201cbeauty\\u201d competition is offensive enough, as is the widespread exclusion of trans women from pageants and, for that matter, men. Then there\\u2019s the term cougar itself, which implies that an older woman who pursues hot young men is just like a predatory animal that can maul and eat you. Ouch.\\nAnd yet, some women are now happily embracing the cougar title and crown. Are we seeing cougar shift from negative connotations to positive ones? The Del Mar pageant rules benignly define cougar as \\u201ca mature woman who pursues younger men, typically more than eight years her junior.\\u201d\\nMiss Cougar 2010, CC Perkinson, actually seems pretty badass. Perkinson was a Del Mar jockey from 1998 to 2005, so gets big kudos right there for being a woman working in a physically demanding, male-dominated industry. (Perhaps that was a point in her favor: Oddly enough, the Del Mar Cougar pageant is actually named after a horse: hall-of-fame racehorse Cougar II.) After winning the pageant, she told NBC Los Angeles:\\nYou can learn from the older, you can learn from the younger and you can have such a great time, and that\\u2019s what this is about.\\nIn a culture that remains uncomfortable with unmarried women, it\\u2019s nice to hear a positive take on aging-while-female. Perkinson added:\\nYou\\u2019ve got to get it in your mind you\\u2019ve got a lot to offer. It empowers women to keep a healthy mind, keep a healthy body, reinvent yourself and realize there\\u2019s men out there that are attracted to you.\\nSo what do you think: Is cougar inherently offensive? Or can it be reclaimed?\\n[polldaddy poll=3562749]\\nPhoto: Mrs. Robinson, the original cougar. Recreating an iconic moment from \\u201cThe Graduate.\\u201d Photo from Flickr user mind on fire under Creative Commons 2.0\\nDating younger men, OK. The term, not so OK.\\nI am THREE (count 'em, 3) years older than my husband and I have had the term \\\"cougar\\\" applied to me. It's ridiculous.\\nWhat's the term for men who date younger women? It's \\\"men\\\". We don't need to apply a special term to women who date younger men.\\nI didn't mind the term when it first came out. I actually saw it as a term of empowerment and ownership of one's sexuality. Then it became popular and (like everything else) the more people used it, the more annoying it became and lost any meaning of power. That said, I do think it is more akin to the term \\\"meterosexual\\\". It is more annoying and overused than anything although of course it has sexist/homophobic undertones.\\nI have heard that Larry King, Michael Douglas and other older men don't get the same label which, to an extent, could be true. That said, I have always had a term for men such as this \\u2013 Dirty Old Man. It isn't exactly a term of endearment.\\nKay \\u2014\\nIt's true, we do have the terms \\\"dirty old man\\\" and \\\"lech\\\" to refer to older men who date younger women \\u2014 but those are usually applied in cases where the guy is MUCH older \\u2014 like old enough to be her parent. Larry King, for example, is 26 years older than his current wife. But when was the last time you heard those kinds of terms applied to the likes of Brad Pitt, who is 11 years older than Angelina Jolie? If she were the older of the two, the media would have undoubtedly pointed it out ad nauseum, whereas in his case it's just accepted as the normal order of things.\\nCougar comes from the effect of a radical face lift. The skin is pulled back from the jaw and cheeks , making the cheekbones very prominent. Eyelids are elongated and slightly tilted. The look isn\\u2019t quite human, more feline. Check out what a cougar\\u2019s face looks like.\\nI agree that the term \\\"cougar\\\" is given to women unfairly and I applaud women who are trying to redefine it. Unfortunately, I think it will be a long time before the word will be a positive term.\\nThere\\u2019s nothing wrong with an older woman dating, having a relationship with, or marrying a younger man. Men have been doing it for centuries. It\\u2019s time for us woman to do what makes us happy and not be concerned about what others may think.\\nI think the word is loosing its teeth and its no depiction of the true person who is attracted to the younger man\\u2026.attraction is a matter of preferance.\",\n          \"Schools programs available\\nRegister now\\nThere are limited spots available so early booking is essential to avoid disappointment.

After winning the pageant, she told NBC Los Angeles:\\nYou can learn from the older, you can learn from the younger and you can have such a great time, and that\\u2019s what this is about.\\nIn a culture that remains uncomfortable with unmarried women, it\\u2019s nice to hear a positive take on aging-while-female. Perkinson added:\\nYou\\u2019ve got to get it in your mind you\\u2019ve got a lot to offer. It empowers women to keep a healthy mind, keep a healthy body, reinvent yourself and realize there\\u2019s men out there that are attracted to you.\\nSo what do you think: Is cougar inherently offensive? Or can it be reclaimed?\\n[polldaddy poll=3562749]\\nPhoto: Mrs. Robinson, the original cougar. Recreating an iconic moment from \\u201cThe Graduate.\\u201d Photo from Flickr user mind on fire under Creative Commons 2.0\\nDating younger men, OK. The term, not so OK.\\nI am THREE (count 'em, 3) years older than my husband and I have had the term \\\"cougar\\\" applied to me. It's ridiculous.\\nWhat's the term for men who date younger women? It's \\\"men\\\". We don't need to apply a special term to women who date younger men.\\nI didn't mind the term when it first came out. I actually saw it as a term of empowerment and ownership of one's sexuality. Then it became popular and (like everything else) the more people used it, the more annoying it became and lost any meaning of power. That said, I do think it is more akin to the term \\\"meterosexual\\\". It is more annoying and overused than anything although of course it has sexist/homophobic undertones.\\nI have heard that Larry King, Michael Douglas and other older men don't get the same label which, to an extent, could be true. That said, I have always had a term for men such as this \\u2013 Dirty Old Man. It isn't exactly a term of endearment.\\nKay \\u2014\\nIt's true, we do have the terms \\\"dirty old man\\\" and \\\"lech\\\" to refer to older men who date younger women \\u2014 but those are usually applied in cases where the guy is MUCH older \\u2014 like old enough to be her parent. Larry King, for example, is 26 years older than his current wife. But when was the last time you heard those kinds of terms applied to the likes of Brad Pitt, who is 11 years older than Angelina Jolie? If she were the older of the two, the media would have undoubtedly pointed it out ad nauseum, whereas in his case it's just accepted as the normal order of things.\\nCougar comes from the effect of a radical face lift. The skin is pulled back from the jaw and cheeks , making the cheekbones very prominent. Eyelids are elongated and slightly tilted. The look isn\\u2019t quite human, more feline. Check out what a cougar\\u2019s face looks like.\\nI agree that the term \\\"cougar\\\" is given to women unfairly and I applaud women who are trying to redefine it. Unfortunately, I think it will be a long time before the word will be a positive term.\\nThere\\u2019s nothing wrong with an older woman dating, having a relationship with, or marrying a younger man. Men have been doing it for centuries. It\\u2019s time for us woman to do what makes us happy and not be concerned about what others may think.\\nI think the word is loosing its teeth and its no depiction of the true person who is attracted to the younger man\\u2026.attraction is a matter of preferance.\",\n          \"Question: What is the purpose of the Football NSW MiniRoos Schools Program?

The way they support human trafficking. The way they can actually throw hardcore porn banner on a legitimate local news site. The worlds most 'democratic' ad network is being undone by the very thing that made it appear everywhere. By placing ads on everything from Youtube channels to Blogger blogs, as well as sites with editorial oversight, Google was the least controlled ad market in the world. As well as the worlds largest, and possibly the laziest as Google suggested that the brands themselves should police the piracy sites, which would be the ad networks job, not the ad buyers.\\nBrands soon took the brunt of appearing on pirated sites, or having their ads support their competitors Youtube channel, receiving complaints and boycotts from consumers. The final straw was the 'extreme' content. For years violent, pirated, and controversial videos have been uploaded and monetized on Youtube and finally hundreds of companies suspended advertising in \\\"row over extremist content\\\" according to The Times in the UK..\\nSo, it's not the ISIS recruitment videos or pirated content that caused the mass exodus of brands, but suddenly popular Youtube channels with \\\"homophobic extremists,\\\" and hate preachers. I do hope they mean the videos showing ISIS soldiers dropping blindfolded men off rooftops, but I doubt that's what they mean.\\nPublicis, the world's third largest advertising agency network said it's now reviewing its relationship with Google. Huge brands have confirmed that they have withdrawn all ads from Google, they include Marks & Spencer, Lloyds Bank, O2, L\\u2019Or\\u00e9al, RBS, the BBC, Channel 4 and McDonald\\u2019s, as well as the British government. The Times say the accounts media buy may be worth \\u00a350 million a year. That kind of money finally made the ad giant sit up and take notice, so Google has just announced 'tougher' policies and hiring spree to prevent brand ads appearing next to extremist content on their blog.\\n\\\"Recently, we had a number of cases where brands\\u2019 ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologize. We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us.\\\" explains Chief Business Officer Eric Schindler. I'm glad you finally realized. He adds:.\\nAnd this is where it starts predictably going downhill. As soon as Google's new hires attempted to put a more granular filter on the content of Youtube that would serve to better target advertising, the LGBT community were upset that their sexual content got filtered out and they re-trended the hashtag #YoutubeisOverParty. That hashtag trended last year when some of the largest youtubers, including potty-mouthed gamers, sarcastic political commentators and satirical channels, discovered that some of their content had been de-monetized without notice. Hundreds of blog posts were written decrying \\\"censorship\\\" as the creators slammed Google for the 'new' policy. The policy wasn't new, just the enforcing of it. But when there is only one basket, and they can decide what gets monetized and what doesn't, that is an issue - and it feels like I've said that before.\\nFor content creators there is good news however, as Google is taking content scraping seriously for once. At least within their own Youtube community..\\nI would ask what will they do with all the revenue they've already generated from monetizing these videos, but it should be fairly obvious: the exact same thing they've been doing all along. Keep it.\\nAnd while increased granular controls for advertisers seems like an obvious solution, it should have been implemented years ago.\\nYou cunts fucking suck. I can't wait until a fucking platform that fucking offers some fucking free speech opens up and a mass exodus of viewers & producers leaves Youtube a ghost town of cucks.\\nRelated post Google is making the web poorer.\",\n          \"Discussion:Set Up Port Forwarding on a Router\\nAt 20:44, Sep 03, 2007\\n72.95.228.64 said:\\nI have a differnet modem than those and it made it harder to do all of that, try adding a westell Versalink 327W...thanks\\nAt 06:57, Sep 28, 2008\\nIsabelishhh said:\\ni have a d-link router and have no idea wich the username and password are, can anyone please help me???\\nAt 18:57, Apr 02, 2009\\n87.67.98.104 said:\\ni have a bbox router or a bbox2 router, and there is no such page as an portforwarding page. or anything that looks like it.. pleas help me\\nAt 16:30, Apr 17, 2009\\n218.248.78.18 said:\\ni am using bsnl evdo usb modem how can i crack open port my down loader shows its blocked\\nI have done this lots of time in Vista on my WRT54GS but seems when I went to Windows 7, my WRT54GS will not SAVE the data, (ports/IP) I enter.\\nI SAVE it, do the CONTINUE but when i return to check what I entered, it is blank.\\nDoes Windows 7 have anything to do with it? i use the Firefox to make the changes.

Context: We've been writing about the many issues Google ads have had for years, they way they appear on everything from ISIS recruitment to pirated content sites. The way they support human trafficking. The way they can actually throw hardcore porn banner on a legitimate local news site. The worlds most 'democratic' ad network is being undone by the very thing that made it appear everywhere. By placing ads on everything from Youtube channels to Blogger blogs, as well as sites with editorial oversight, Google was the least controlled ad market in the world. As well as the worlds largest, and possibly the laziest as Google suggested that the brands themselves should police the piracy sites, which would be the ad networks job, not the ad buyers.\\nBrands soon took the brunt of appearing on pirated sites, or having their ads support their competitors Youtube channel, receiving complaints and boycotts from consumers. The final straw was the 'extreme' content. For years violent, pirated, and controversial videos have been uploaded and monetized on Youtube and finally hundreds of companies suspended advertising in \\\"row over extremist content\\\" according to The Times in the UK..\\nSo, it's not the ISIS recruitment videos or pirated content that caused the mass exodus of brands, but suddenly popular Youtube channels with \\\"homophobic extremists,\\\" and hate preachers. I do hope they mean the videos showing ISIS soldiers dropping blindfolded men off rooftops, but I doubt that's what they mean.\\nPublicis, the world's third largest advertising agency network said it's now reviewing its relationship with Google. Huge brands have confirmed that they have withdrawn all ads from Google, they include Marks & Spencer, Lloyds Bank, O2, L\\u2019Or\\u00e9al, RBS, the BBC, Channel 4 and McDonald\\u2019s, as well as the British government. The Times say the accounts media buy may be worth \\u00a350 million a year. That kind of money finally made the ad giant sit up and take notice, so Google has just announced 'tougher' policies and hiring spree to prevent brand ads appearing next to extremist content on their blog.\\n\\\"Recently, we had a number of cases where brands\\u2019 ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologize. We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us.\\\" explains Chief Business Officer Eric Schindler. I'm glad you finally realized. He adds:.\\nAnd this is where it starts predictably going downhill. As soon as Google's new hires attempted to put a more granular filter on the content of Youtube that would serve to better target advertising, the LGBT community were upset that their sexual content got filtered out and they re-trended the hashtag #YoutubeisOverParty. That hashtag trended last year when some of the largest youtubers, including potty-mouthed gamers, sarcastic political commentators and satirical channels, discovered that some of their content had been de-monetized without notice. Hundreds of blog posts were written decrying \\\"censorship\\\" as the creators slammed Google for the 'new' policy. The policy wasn't new, just the enforcing of it. But when there is only one basket, and they can decide what gets monetized and what doesn't, that is an issue - and it feels like I've said that before.\\nFor content creators there is good news however, as Google is taking content scraping seriously for once. At least within their own Youtube community..\\nI would ask what will they do with all the revenue they've already generated from monetizing these videos, but it should be fairly obvious: the exact same thing they've been doing all along. Keep it.\\nAnd while increased granular controls for advertisers seems like an obvious solution, it should have been implemented years ago.\\nYou cunts fucking suck. I can't wait until a fucking platform that fucking offers some fucking free speech opens up and a mass exodus of viewers & producers leaves Youtube a ghost town of cucks.\\nRelated post Google is making the web poorer.\",\n          \"Question: What issue does the user with IP 218.248.78.18 face with their bsnl evdo usb modem?

The temperature is currently 2-3 degrees below normal, and would continue for the next two-three days. \\\"After that, the city might witness a slight rise in temperature.\\\"\\nIMD officials said that as the northern parts of the country cool further, the temperature in the city might drop a bit more towards the end of the year or early in January. \\\"The temperature is likely to stay between 15 and 16 degrees C for the next few days,\\\" said an official.\\nIf other parts of the country get even cooler, Mumbai might see some drop in the maximum temperature in the coming few days,\\\" said an official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\\nOfficials said that last December, the maximum temperature in the city had dropped to about 30 degrees C around this time of the year giving Mumbaikars a respite from the heat during the day.

The way they support human trafficking. The way they can actually throw hardcore porn banner on a legitimate local news site. The worlds most 'democratic' ad network is being undone by the very thing that made it appear everywhere. By placing ads on everything from Youtube channels to Blogger blogs, as well as sites with editorial oversight, Google was the least controlled ad market in the world. As well as the worlds largest, and possibly the laziest as Google suggested that the brands themselves should police the piracy sites, which would be the ad networks job, not the ad buyers.\\nBrands soon took the brunt of appearing on pirated sites, or having their ads support their competitors Youtube channel, receiving complaints and boycotts from consumers. The final straw was the 'extreme' content. For years violent, pirated, and controversial videos have been uploaded and monetized on Youtube and finally hundreds of companies suspended advertising in \\\"row over extremist content\\\" according to The Times in the UK..\\nSo, it's not the ISIS recruitment videos or pirated content that caused the mass exodus of brands, but suddenly popular Youtube channels with \\\"homophobic extremists,\\\" and hate preachers. I do hope they mean the videos showing ISIS soldiers dropping blindfolded men off rooftops, but I doubt that's what they mean.\\nPublicis, the world's third largest advertising agency network said it's now reviewing its relationship with Google. Huge brands have confirmed that they have withdrawn all ads from Google, they include Marks & Spencer, Lloyds Bank, O2, L\\u2019Or\\u00e9al, RBS, the BBC, Channel 4 and McDonald\\u2019s, as well as the British government. The Times say the accounts media buy may be worth \\u00a350 million a year. That kind of money finally made the ad giant sit up and take notice, so Google has just announced 'tougher' policies and hiring spree to prevent brand ads appearing next to extremist content on their blog.\\n\\\"Recently, we had a number of cases where brands\\u2019 ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologize. We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us.\\\" explains Chief Business Officer Eric Schindler. I'm glad you finally realized. He adds:.\\nAnd this is where it starts predictably going downhill. As soon as Google's new hires attempted to put a more granular filter on the content of Youtube that would serve to better target advertising, the LGBT community were upset that their sexual content got filtered out and they re-trended the hashtag #YoutubeisOverParty. That hashtag trended last year when some of the largest youtubers, including potty-mouthed gamers, sarcastic political commentators and satirical channels, discovered that some of their content had been de-monetized without notice. Hundreds of blog posts were written decrying \\\"censorship\\\" as the creators slammed Google for the 'new' policy. The policy wasn't new, just the enforcing of it. But when there is only one basket, and they can decide what gets monetized and what doesn't, that is an issue - and it feels like I've said that before.\\nFor content creators there is good news however, as Google is taking content scraping seriously for once. At least within their own Youtube community..\\nI would ask what will they do with all the revenue they've already generated from monetizing these videos, but it should be fairly obvious: the exact same thing they've been doing all along. Keep it.\\nAnd while increased granular controls for advertisers seems like an obvious solution, it should have been implemented years ago.\\nYou cunts fucking suck. I can't wait until a fucking platform that fucking offers some fucking free speech opens up and a mass exodus of viewers & producers leaves Youtube a ghost town of cucks.\\nRelated post Google is making the web poorer.\",\n          \"Discussion:Set Up Port Forwarding on a Router\\nAt 20:44, Sep 03, 2007\\n72.95.228.64 said:\\nI have a differnet modem than those and it made it harder to do all of that, try adding a westell Versalink 327W...thanks\\nAt 06:57, Sep 28, 2008\\nIsabelishhh said:\\ni have a d-link router and have no idea wich the username and password are, can anyone please help me???\\nAt 18:57, Apr 02, 2009\\n87.67.98.104 said:\\ni have a bbox router or a bbox2 router, and there is no such page as an portforwarding page. or anything that looks like it.. pleas help me\\nAt 16:30, Apr 17, 2009\\n218.248.78.18 said:\\ni am using bsnl evdo usb modem how can i crack open port my down loader shows its blocked\\nI have done this lots of time in Vista on my WRT54GS but seems when I went to Windows 7, my WRT54GS will not SAVE the data, (ports/IP) I enter.\\nI SAVE it, do the CONTINUE but when i return to check what I entered, it is blank.\\nDoes Windows 7 have anything to do with it? i use the Firefox to make the changes.

Context: We've been writing about the many issues Google ads have had for years, they way they appear on everything from ISIS recruitment to pirated content sites. The way they support human trafficking. The way they can actually throw hardcore porn banner on a legitimate local news site. The worlds most 'democratic' ad network is being undone by the very thing that made it appear everywhere. By placing ads on everything from Youtube channels to Blogger blogs, as well as sites with editorial oversight, Google was the least controlled ad market in the world. As well as the worlds largest, and possibly the laziest as Google suggested that the brands themselves should police the piracy sites, which would be the ad networks job, not the ad buyers.\\nBrands soon took the brunt of appearing on pirated sites, or having their ads support their competitors Youtube channel, receiving complaints and boycotts from consumers. The final straw was the 'extreme' content. For years violent, pirated, and controversial videos have been uploaded and monetized on Youtube and finally hundreds of companies suspended advertising in \\\"row over extremist content\\\" according to The Times in the UK..\\nSo, it's not the ISIS recruitment videos or pirated content that caused the mass exodus of brands, but suddenly popular Youtube channels with \\\"homophobic extremists,\\\" and hate preachers. I do hope they mean the videos showing ISIS soldiers dropping blindfolded men off rooftops, but I doubt that's what they mean.\\nPublicis, the world's third largest advertising agency network said it's now reviewing its relationship with Google. Huge brands have confirmed that they have withdrawn all ads from Google, they include Marks & Spencer, Lloyds Bank, O2, L\\u2019Or\\u00e9al, RBS, the BBC, Channel 4 and McDonald\\u2019s, as well as the British government. The Times say the accounts media buy may be worth \\u00a350 million a year. That kind of money finally made the ad giant sit up and take notice, so Google has just announced 'tougher' policies and hiring spree to prevent brand ads appearing next to extremist content on their blog.\\n\\\"Recently, we had a number of cases where brands\\u2019 ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologize. We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us.\\\" explains Chief Business Officer Eric Schindler. I'm glad you finally realized. He adds:.\\nAnd this is where it starts predictably going downhill. As soon as Google's new hires attempted to put a more granular filter on the content of Youtube that would serve to better target advertising, the LGBT community were upset that their sexual content got filtered out and they re-trended the hashtag #YoutubeisOverParty. That hashtag trended last year when some of the largest youtubers, including potty-mouthed gamers, sarcastic political commentators and satirical channels, discovered that some of their content had been de-monetized without notice. Hundreds of blog posts were written decrying \\\"censorship\\\" as the creators slammed Google for the 'new' policy. The policy wasn't new, just the enforcing of it. But when there is only one basket, and they can decide what gets monetized and what doesn't, that is an issue - and it feels like I've said that before.\\nFor content creators there is good news however, as Google is taking content scraping seriously for once. At least within their own Youtube community..\\nI would ask what will they do with all the revenue they've already generated from monetizing these videos, but it should be fairly obvious: the exact same thing they've been doing all along. Keep it.\\nAnd while increased granular controls for advertisers seems like an obvious solution, it should have been implemented years ago.\\nYou cunts fucking suck. I can't wait until a fucking platform that fucking offers some fucking free speech opens up and a mass exodus of viewers & producers leaves Youtube a ghost town of cucks.\\nRelated post Google is making the web poorer.\",\n          \"Question: What issue does the user with IP 218.248.78.18 face with their bsnl evdo usb modem?

            "Context: How unequal is India? The question is simple, the answer is not.\n",
            "For some 60 years, the only reliable information about India’s inequality was coming from the annual National Sample Survey conducted from 1951. NSS is one of the most venerable surveys in the world of poverty and income distribution statistics. India started fielding it soon after its independence: the survey was supposed to track how the new government fought poverty, to provide information on caste differences, rural-urban gap, caloric intake, especially of the poor and many other statistics. Since its main concern was with poverty, the decision was made to survey consumption, that is, how much people actually consume (do they have sufficient number of calories) rather than income (how many rupees they earn).\n",
            "For all these decades since 1951 NSS was the key instrument that allowed researchers from India and the rest of the world as well as Indian policymakers to know what is happening with India’s population. India could thus boast to have had a longer series of annual surveys than most rich countries (that often launched their similar surveys in the 1960s). But in addition the survey also benefited from some reflected glory which had to do with the ideals and hopes raised by the Independence and thus it had a bit of this Third World-Bandoeng Summit-Mahalanobis glow always attached to it.\n",
            "But the problems started in the 1990s when the survey numbers began to diverge more and more from National Accounts statistics: NSS was showing consistently lower rates of growth, and higher poverty than many people thought it should be given India’s fast growth. This led to the famous Great India Poverty debate in which participated Angus Deaton, Amartya Sen, Jean Drèze, T.N. Srinivasan, S. Subramanian, Martin Ravallion and many others. Several representative articles are given here and here and here.\n",
            "The gap between the slow moving survey mean and much faster changes in per capita GDP was also explained by the failure of NSS to capture top incomes. The top incomes may have been pulling up the mean (presumably reflected in GDP per capita) and if surveys continued, partly by design and partly by the reluctance of the rich to participate, to be focused on the bottom of the income distribution, that could explain the rising gap between NSS and national accounts.\n",
            "And if indeed that was the reason, or one of the reasons, then another unpleasant conclusion imposed itself: inequality in India may be (far) higher than implied by NSS data.\n",
            "And indeed, as the graph below shows, NSS kept on producing a fairly stable consumption Gini (calculated here on household per capita basis) over several decades, with only a small increase in inequality after India’s sharp turn toward capitalism in the early 1990s. That Gini, ranging between mid- and higher-30s, made India inequality look about the same as in developed countries.\n",
            "/>\n",
            "But until recently we had no other reliable and nationally-representative survey to confront NSS with. Now, thanks to the joint work by University of Maryland and National Council of Applied Research in New Delhi, we have (harmonized by LIS), the first income based surveys of Indian population for 2004 and, just released by LIS, another same survey for 2011.\n",
            "And the results are very different from NSS’s. First, Indian Gini is remarkably consistent in both 2004 and 2011 and is (on per capita basis) 51 Gini points. This is at the level of Latin American countries and is some 15 points (or almost 40% ) higher than the Gini’s calculated from NSS. Thus a key question is immediately asked: is India’s inequality more like Latin American? NSS was saying for years that it is not; the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) argues it is.\n",
            "For 2011, I have both micro data from NSS and micro data from IHDS and when I compare income/consumption by each percentile (note that these are entirely different people though), the results do make sense. For the lowest percentiles, consumption is about twice income, and everybody up to the 33rd percentile consumes more than their income (which you would expect in a poor environment). After that point, consumption consistently and monotonically falls short of income (that is, there is saving), so much that among the top 5%, income is twice as high as consumption (saving rate is 50%). Overall, the mean per capita income from IHDS is 47 percent higher than the mean per capita consumption from NSS, and as we have said, Gini is some 15 points higher.\n",
            "This “reasonableness” of the data, and the absence of discontinuities when comparing income and consumption leads one to believe that it is possible that both NSS and IHDS provide accurate information (with likely underestimation of top-end consumption and income), but that income distribution in India is much more unequally distributed than consumption.\n",
            "So if we compare India with other countries that use income surveys, this is how it looks (see the figure below). India seems slightly more unequal than Brazil, and more egalitarian than only South Africa.\n",
            "There are many other issues that are worth exploring here, in particular if we want to look more carefully at the consistency between the two surveys, but I would like to end by considering the role of the new income survey for India from an unusual angle.\n",
            "As mentioned before, since NSS was the only game in town, all our global poverty and inequality statistics were done using NSS. Now, if we replace NSS with the new income survey as I have done for the global inequality calculation for the year 2011 (unpublished), you may expect that the greater inequality revealed by IHDS would push global inequality up, especially since India is such a populous country. Right?\n",
            "Wrong.\n",
            "What happens is that global inequality goes down by approximately 1 Gini point since the higher income levels implied by IHDS push Indians toward the middle of the global income distribution and more than offset the contribution to higher global inequality that comes from the stretched-out Indian distribution. Thus, somewhat paradoxically, a global implication of a new, and I think more reasonable, approach of viewing India as a country with Latin American levels of income inequality is that global inequality, as calculated so far, might have been overestimated.\n",
            "In conclusion, more unequal but richer India, makes the world more equal.\n",
            "Note: Only a member of this blog may post a comment.\n",
            "Question: What is the main difference between the National Sample Survey (NSS) and the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) in terms of measuring India's inequality?\n",
            "Answer: The main difference between the NSS and the IHDS in terms of measuring India's inequality is that the NSS focused on consumption, that is, how much people actually consume, while the IHDS is based on income. The NSS was showing consistently lower rates of growth and higher poverty, while the IHDS revealed a higher level of inequality, similar to Latin American countries.\n",

            "It is said that one calamity brings another. The flood in Pakistan has brought along with it many tragedies. In a country already stricken with poverty and backwardness the flood waters have not only brought death but also misery which is more painful than death. The southern part of the largest province of Punjab and North Sindh, where there are huge land holdings, millions of people living below the extreme poverty line are being devastated by the floods. Neighbouring Multan, the districts of Muzzafargarh, Bahawalpur, Rajanpur, and Rahim Yar Khan along with Kashmore, Ghotki and Jacobabad are being hit by destructive floods. The 1,150,000 cusecs gush in the Indus has pulverized the already rotten state infrastructure. Numerous levees have been breached, resulting in the ruin of millions of people.\n",
            "In the beginning the flood affected the Sindhi and Baloch tribes settled along the banks who were already living miserable lives. Although these tribes were accustomed to very harsh and insecure living conditions the number of deaths caused by this flood have tested their endurance against natural disasters.\n",
            "Trotsky said that life targets the weak. The flood has affected everyone but the most affected are the weakest sections of society, namely the women and children. Women in these areas are the most exploited section of the population and are now suffering the most. Under normal circumstances the women of these areas have to work much more than the men do. Many of the men are forced into crime and are involved in armed robberies, kidnappings and theft. The rest are employed in rearing livestock and as farm labourers. The women, while being constantly in labour have to do household work and gather, process and feed the fodder to the cattle and along with that have to completely subjugate themselves to their men and face domestic violence.\n",
            "The Pakistan Trade Union Defence Campaign’s mobile medical relief team came across a woman, on the bank of the Fazil Wah canal, who was drenched in the constant downpour of rain. Her eldest child was 2 years of age, she had 12 month old twins and she was eight months pregnant. She was suffering from allergy and had a fever. The women have to reproduce for as long as they remain fertile and in tribal culture this is considered as a means of proving the manhood of a man and the utility of the woman. A pregnant woman with an infant in her lap; such scenes are everywhere. The flood has taken in its toll on many such mothers and their children. The destruction caused by the flood has intensified the day to day misery of the women in labour. Premature births, bleeding, aches, death of unborn babies and other gynaecological disease are widespread. Pregnant women who need rest or at least a comfortable situation are lying under the sun and in the rain, fighting a battle with death. A woman when questioned told us that death is better than life under such conditions.\n",
            "Epidemics are spreading in the flood hit areas. The greatest problem is that of clean drinking water. All the victims of conjunctivitis and skin diseases are flood victims and now these diseases are spreading towards the unaffected population. Among children diarrhoea, dehydration, water born diseases, stomach pain, conjunctivitis, respiratory and chest diseases are common. Dehydrated children are falling victims to Cholera and chest infections. Skin allergies are rotting their skins. If due to the continuous pregnancies under normal circumstances the mothers are unable to take proper care of their infants it is impossible in such an emergency situation. 80% of infants are suffering from severe diseases and they need immediate hospitalisation.\n",
            "In such conditions the mobile medical team of Sadiqabad Pakistan Trade Union Defence Campaign has treated 8276 patients so far and has given them free medicines, the price of which amounts to almost Rs. 720,000. The PTUDC medical team has only common and emergency medicines. A well equipped ambulance is also required. Many women and children can only be treated in a hospital. The only hospital within reach is in Rahim Yar Khan, very far from the affected areas (50km-100km).\n",
            "The conditions in the government relief camps is even worse. The rain on August 16 was between 6 and 18 inches [15 to 45 centimetres] in all the camps. There is lack of planning and the bureaucracy is using the old principal of “Look busy do nothing”. 98% of affected people are out of the government’s reach and are waiting for a miracle. People are being weakened due to hunger and disease. So far the citizens of Rahim Yar Khan and Sadiqabad in their compassion have been providing food to the victims in an unorganized manner. The time-gap between the delivery of meals is sometimes up to 3 days. In many places nothing has been delivered at all. Many people have only the clothes that they were wearing when they fled for their lives.\n",
            "Intensifying the tragedy of these lamenting and dying people are their tribal traditions. Sitting side by side, the victims of the flood do not socially mix together. Their honour, tribal pride and bad bloods have not left them even in the face of death. Similarly those associated with crime are carrying on their activities. So far there have been two attacks on the PTUDC mobile medical team. Kidnappers forced our vehicle into the forest but we were successful in escaping before reaching their hideout. On the second occasion our vehicle was attacked by dacoits on the rainy night of August 16, who took away many medicines.\n",
            "In spite of all these difficulties, we will keep on helping the dying people in all circumstances. Right now flood victims are lying in jungles, plains and fields. It is our revolutionary duty to do what we can to save their lives. Our resources contributed by our friends and comrades are very limited. We need a complete ambulance, quality medicine and many doctors. But we will keep on working with revolutionary spirit.\n",

I think we are suffering from what is called the narrative crisis,” said veteran director and producer Mahesh Bhatt.\\nHe contrasts modern filmmakers with Dhundiraj Govind Phalke, known as the “father of Indian cinema”, who brought the first all-Indian feature film to the silver screen in Bombay (now Mumbai) on May 3, 1913.\\nA tale from the Hindu epic Mahabharata, Raja Harishchandra, quickly became a hit despite its female characters being played by men — women acting was still widely frowned upon.\\nPhalke made more than 100 films until his silent style fell victim to “talkies” in the 1930s, but the advent of sound technology allowed India cinema to flourish.\\nBollywood plot-lines today can involve stars breaking into song, often in picturesque far-flung locations, apropos of nothing — a style that may bemuse a Western audience, but one that helps to set Indian cinema apart.\\n“If it was exactly the same thing as Hollywood, Hollywood would have run us over. We don’t have that money,” said film critic Anupama Chopra.\\nFor her and many others the “golden age” of cinema was the 1950s, when movie greats emerged such as Satyajit Ray, India’s most renowned filmmaker, who hailed from the alternative film hub of West Bengal.\\nIt was the era of newly independent India, searching for an identity and producing films such as Mehboob Khan’s 1957 hit Mother India, which combined social concerns with popular appeal.\\nThe 1970s and 80s saw a growing commercialism with the rise of the “masala” movie — a family entertainer that typically mixed up romance and action, songs and melodrama, a comedy touch and a happy ending.\\nParallel Cinema continued to focus on realism, with films such as Mahesh Bhatt’s Arth (Meaning) in 1982, a gritty tale of an extramarital affair that presented strong female characters.\\nIt was a path-breaker in a decade described as the “dark ages” of Hindi cinema, which struggled with the advent of colour television, rampant piracy and dependence on the Mumbai underworld for funding.\\nThings improved after India’s economy opened up in the early 1990s, and again a decade later when filmmaking won formal “industry” status. Both steps encouraged foreign firms, such as Fox and Disney, to invest in Bollywood..”']\n",
